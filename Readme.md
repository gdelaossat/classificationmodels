This notebook contains an Exploratory data analysis of the Mision TIC 2020 scholarship program dataset. 

I used machine learning algorithms and Neural networks to classify students with the probability of completing the program. 

In this dataset, we could identify imbalanced categories and then explore different techniques to deal with them.
